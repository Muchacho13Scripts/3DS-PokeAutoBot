3DS link trade bot

A lot has been added, most of it is semi functional. For those you finding your way here because you want to host a bot. If you are not a developer it is best to wait until a release is posted. A lot needs to be added, currently it only functions on usum, so s/m compatibility still needs to be added, as well as x/y and ORAS. It is a work in project and I am working on it daily to get it at least up and running as quickly as I can. Patience is appreciated and a release will be posted once I feel it is ready for general consumption. 

Expect frequent updates, a more thorough guide will be made once the project is actually complete.

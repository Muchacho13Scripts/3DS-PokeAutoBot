3DS link trade bot

This is very very very much a work in progress but the barebones are here. It works with Boot NTR CFW to inject pokemon and such. It uses LUMA3ds built in Input redirection to control, this is what gives it the ability to a. access the home button b. inject with Boot NTR even when the game kills the wifi.

Expect frequent updates, a more thorough guide will be made once the project is actually complete.
